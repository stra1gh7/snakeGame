## How to play

### Controls:
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.

### Objective: 
Eat as much food as possible to score points and grow the snake longer.
Avoid running into the snake's own tail, as this will end the game.

### Scoring:
Each piece of food eaten adds 20 points to your score.
The longer the snake gets, the higher your score will be.

### Game over:
The game ends when the snake collides with its own tail.
Your final score will be displayed, and you can choose whether you want to play again or not.
